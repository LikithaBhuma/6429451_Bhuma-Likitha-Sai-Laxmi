  <h2>Community Bulletin: May Highlights</h2>

  <section class="bulletin-article">
    The month of May brought a series of exciting events to our local community. From the annual food festival that showcased delicacies from every corner of the region, to the vibrant art walk held downtown, residents had a chance to connect, create, and celebrate. 

    The community garden project also kicked off with over 50 volunteers helping prepare planting beds for the summer season. In addition, the neighborhood cleanup initiative gathered more than 100 residents who worked together to beautify public parks and sidewalks. 

    The city council introduced a new bike-sharing program aimed at promoting green transport and reducing traffic congestion. Local schools also reported increased participation in after-school programs, especially in arts and robotics clubs.

    As we move into June, more cultural and recreational activities are planned, including movie nights in the park, open mic poetry evenings, and youth coding bootcamps. Stay tuned for more updates and be part of the growing community spirit!
